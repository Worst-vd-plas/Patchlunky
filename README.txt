1. Description
==============

Patchlunky is a mod manager for Spelunky HD.

Features of Patchlunky include:

  * Easily install/uninstall mods.
  * Support for most existing Spelunky HD mods.
  * Multiple mods can be patched to the game at the same time.[*]
  * Change any of the 20 player characters in the game.
  * Load .png files as custom character skins.
  * Dedicated file types for mods and characters (*.plm and *.plc).
  * XML based mods and characters that support additional features.
  * Custom URL protocol for downloading mods or characters directly into Patchlunky.
  * Lua scripting support for mods (it is quite limited atm)


[*] If multiple mods contain the same file(s) or resource(s), the last mod patched will override the previous mod(s).


2. System Requirements
======================

* .NET Framework 4
* around 400 MB free space for backups and temporary files.


3. Using Patchlunky
===================

When you launch Patchlunky for the first time, the setup wizard will ask you for the
path to the game. If you have the steam or GOG version of Spelunky HD, you can let
Patchlunky find the game folder automatically, otherwise you'll need to browse to it manually.

The setup wizard will also ask about backing up the original game files, this is required
for Patchlunky to function at all. Before you let Patchlunky perform the backup make sure
that your game is not modded! Patchlunky will use the data from the files that it backs up
as a base for patching mods to.

Finally the setup wizard will ask about registering the Patchlunky URL protocol with your
system. This allows opening special links in your web browser that interact with Patchlunky.
What this means in practise is that by clicking on a link you can let Patchlunky download
a mod to the correct location without you having to manually save it in the right folder.

After you are done with these steps, the Patchlunky main window will appear. There are four
tabs and also a bottom part below the tabs that is visible regardless of the active tab.


Bottom part
-----------
The bottom part includes buttons for patching or launching the game, a progress bar for
showing patch progress and a log message display.

Patch Game button:
  Patches the currently selected Mods and Characters to the game.
  (Make sure that you don't have Spelunky opened when pressing this)

Launch Game button: 
  Launches Spelunky HD.


Mods
----
The Mods tab displays a checked listbox of mods that Patchlunky has found from the Mods folder
located inside the Patchlunky folder. If you add a new mod while Patchlunky is running, you
can refresh the list of mods by clicking the 'Reload Mods' button found in the Downloads tab.

At the top left there is a combo box that shows the active saved mod list. The saved mod lists
specify which mods are checked, and what the order of the mods is. You can create custom saved
mod lists by typing a name in the combo box and pressing the 'Save' button next to it.

You can select a mod in the list of mods and click the up/down buttons to move it before/after
another mod to change the order in which the mods are patched to the game. This only makes
difference if two mods affect the same resources in the game, and you wish to have one override
the other.


Characters
----------
The Characters tab displays a tile view of the game characters. In order to change one of the
characters, you can double-click a character to switch to the character browser. The character
browser looks the same but the background is cyan instead. It includes the default characters
and also any characters it finds from the Skins folder located inside the Patchlunky folder.
Double-clicking a character in the browser will make it replace the character that you double-
clicked before.

The Characters tab also includes a combo box for selecting the active saved character list.
It works the same way as saved mod lists do, but for characters.


Downloads
---------
The Downloads tab displays a list of downloads for the current session. Downloads can be moved
up/down in the list to change their queueing order. You can remove a download from the list by
pressing the 'Remove' button, but note that files are not removed for completed downloads.

To remove files you can press the 'Open Mods folder' or 'Open Characters folder' button to open
the appropiate folder in Windows Explorer, and then delete the file of your choice from there.

Reload Mods button:
  Scans the 'Mods' folder for mods and then refreshes the list of mods.

Reload Characters button:
  Scans the 'Skins' folder for characters and then refreshes the list of characters.


Settings
--------
At the top left of the settings tab you can see the status of Patchlunky. If everything in the
status box is "OK.", Patchlunky should be functional.

Setup Patchlunky button:
  You can press this button to force the Patchlunky Setup wizard to run again.

Restore default game files:
  This will replace the game files with the backups that were created with the Patchlunky setup
  wizard. If you want custom characters but no mods, you should instead uncheck all the mods,
  and press the Patch Game button so that it only patches the characters.

Mods can replace default characters:
  Allows mods to replace any default characters that have not been assigned a custom character.
  If you want to see characters included inside mods, make sure to enable this setting. Select
  'Reset ALL characters' in the Characters tab to ensure that you have the default
  characters.

Autosave mod list:
  Enables saving the current mod list when patching or closing Patchlunky.

Autosave character list:
  Enables saving the current character list when patching or closing Patchlunky.

Ask permission to run scripts:
  When this setting is enabled, Patchlunky will ask for permission to run patch scripts while
  patching. If this setting is disabled, patch scripts will ALWAYS run during patching.


4. Making mods for Patchlunky
=============================

Simple mods
-----------
An easy way to start a new mod for Patchlunky is to make a folder inside the Mods folder, using
the name of the new mod as the folder name. This new folder inside the Mods folder will contain
the contents of your mod.

Inside your mod folder you can create subfolders and files the same way as they would show up in
the Spelunky\Data directory. A Patchlunky mod may contain modded versions of most of the spelunky
data files.

It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED however that you DO NOT include modified alltex or allsounds WADs, as
they go against the idea of being able to combine multiple different mods together.

Instead of including the WAD files, you should create a folder at the location where the WAD file
would be, naming that folder like the WAD file, but without the file extension. So for example
naming the folder 'alltex' or 'allsounds'. Inside that folder create subfolders that match the
WAD groups that your mod affects, and then include the .png or .wav files that your mod changes.
See 'Patchlunky Example Mod 1' for an example on how to do this.

In the main folder of your mod, you should create a textfile named "readme.txt" in which you can
write a description of the mod. You can also include a .png image named "picture.png" for your mod,
which should be 16:9 in aspect ratio, and recommended resolution is 512x288.
Patchlunky will display the text (and picture if supplied) in the Mod tab when the mod is selected.

When you are done making your mod, you should zip the CONTENTS of your mod folder (but not the mod 
folder itself), and rename the .zip file extension of the archive to ".plm".

For example "my mod.zip" -> "my mod.plm"

Then move the .plm file to the Patchlunky Mods folder, and move the main folder of your mod somewhere
elsewhere outside the Patchlunky Mods folder, leaving only the .plm file there. Launch Patchlunky,
and verify that the .plm file for your mod is working properly.

If everything works, you are ready to distribute the .plm file containing your mod!
(Note: There is no need to put the .plm file into a zip for distribution, because it is one already)


XML-mods
--------
Mods that include a 'mod.xml' file, will be treated according to the properties they specify in the
xml file. See 'Patchlunky Example Mod 2' for an example.

Supported tags:
  * Name : Name of the mod.
  * Id : Unique ID for the mod, used for detecting duplicates, etc.
  * Version : Version number or string for the mod.
  * Date : The date the mod was finished, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
  * Author : Name of the author(s) of the mod.
  * Email : Contact email for the mod.
  * WebUrl : Web address for the mod.
  * Description : The description of the mod.
  * TextFile : Path to text file with description, overrides the 'Description' tag.
  * PreviewImage : Image displayed for the mod in the mod manager.
  * PatchlunkyVersion : Minimum Patchlunky version required for the mod to work.
  * PatchDefaultFiles : Set to true to copy any matching file from the mod folders.
  * PatchScript : Path to a Lua patchscript file for the mod.


XML-characters
--------------
Characters can be created in a way similar to XML-mods, by including a 'character.xml' file inside
a zip file with the '.plc' file extension. See 'hiredhand.plc' for an example.

Supported tags:
  * Name : Name of the character.
  * Id : Unique ID for the character, used for detecting duplicates, etc.
  * Version : Version number or string for the character.
  * Date : The date the character was finished, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
  * Author : Name of the author(s) of the character.
  * Email : Contact email for the character.
  * WebUrl : Web address for the character.
  * Description : The description of the character.
  * TextFile : Path to text file with description, overrides the 'Description' tag.
  * PreviewImage : Image displayed for the character in the mod manager.
  * PatchlunkyVersion : Minimum Patchlunky version required for the character to work.
  * CharacterImage : The spritesheet for the character.
  * LeaderboardImage : Image to display in leaderboards, 128x48 pixels.
                       To match with original images, the image should have:
                       - a 128px wide and 6px high transparent area
                       - a 128px wide and 36px high portrait area
                       - a 128px wide and 6px high transparent area
                       (Note that other people will not see the image unless they
                        have exactly the same characters patched into the game)

5. Lua Scripting Support
==========================
Patchlunky mods can include a 'patch script' written in the Lua scripting language. These scripts
can patch the game files in more advanced ways than simply replacing game files.

The mods that make use of Lua scripts are more likely to be compatible with other mods since the
scripts allow for more accurate patching, affecting less of the content that is unrelated to the
mod at hand. This can also reduce the file size of mods when entire files don't have to be included.


Security
--------
Scripts in Patchlunky are sandboxed using Lua itself to create a restricted environment for the
scripts. In the Lua sandbox the scripts only have access to a specific subset of the Lua functions.

The functions for loading and saving mod resources are restricted from acting outside of their
intended purposes. There are limits to loading too many concurrent resources and limits to writing
too many resources to the disk.

Currently there is no protection against infinite loops and the like, which will result in the
program hanging and ceasing to respond. In a such scenario the program will need to be terminated
from the task manager.

Despite the measures in place to prevent misuse, there still remains the possibility that a
malicious user could exploit a bug or vulnerability in order to break out of the sandbox, and then
breach into the system.

It is probably a good idea to treat scripts with the same amount of precaution that you would treat
any unknown piece of software with. (Note that antivirus software is unlikely to detect whether or
not a script is safe.) If you are unsure about a script, you could ask other people for help or you
could try studying the script yourself. (The source is always inside the mod, patchlunky does not
allow pre-compiled scripts.)

Ideally the Lua scripting interpreter would be sandboxed at the process level or even the operating
system level to increase the fail-security of the program. Unfortunately this is not the case yet,
and as such you have to be more careful with the scripts. At the time of writing this, I am not
aware of any exploit in Patchlunky that would allow breaking out of the sandbox.

The following Patchlunky Lua features are supported:
  * language.get (key)
    This function returns the spelunky localization string for the specified key.

  * language.set (key, value)
    This function sets the spelunky localization string for the specified key.

  * soundlist.set (key, val1, val2, val3)
    This function sets the spelunky soundlist reverb values for the specified key.

  * program.getinput (message, default_value)
    This function displays an input dialog with the given message. The default_value will be set
    into the text input field of the dialog. Returns the string in the text input field, unless
    the dialog is canceled, in which case the default_value string is returned instead.

  * image.load (path)
    This function loads an image from the specified relative path. By default this is relative to
    the mod folder. Prefix with 'game:' to have the path be relative to the spelunky data folder.
    Prefix with 'alltex.wad:' to have the path be relative to the wad archive. For wad archives,
    separate the group and entry name with a forward slash. Returns an Image object if the image
    was successfully loaded.

  * image.new (width, height [, color{r,g,b,a}])
    This function creates an image with the specified size and optional background color specified
    by a table. Returns an Image object if the image was successfully created.

  - Image:clone()
    This method returns a clone of this Image object.

  - Image:free()
    This method disposes of the resources used by the Image object. You need to call this if you
    are loading more than 50 images in your script.

  - Image:save (path)
    This method saves the Image to the specified relative path. By default this is relative to
    the spelunky data folder. Prefix with 'alltex.wad:' to have the path be relative to the wad
    archive instead. During execution a patch script may only save to each path once, so images
    should only be saved once they are completely finished.

  - Image:draw_image (SrcImage, x, y, mode)
  - Image:draw_image (SrcImage, x, y, w, h, mode)
  - Image:draw_image (SrcImage, x, y, w, h, srcx, srcy, srcw, srch, mode)
    These methods draw the specified source image on top of the Image calling this method.
    x and y specify the location and w and h the size of the source image. srcx, srcy, srcw, srch
    specify the portion of the source image to draw. If srcw or srch are either 0 or unspecified,
    then the full source width or full source height will be used in their place. If w or h are
    either 0 or unspecified, then the srcw or srch will be used in their place. mode specifies the
    way the source image is drawn, supported values are:
      MODE_REPLACE Pixels replace the pixels in the image being drawn to regardless of their alpha.
      MODE_OVERLAY Pixels are blended to the image being drawn to based on their alpha component.

Patch scripts may not load/create/clone more than 50 images at once. If you want to load more, you
have to first call Image:free() on images that you are no longer using. All the images loaded by
the script will be freed automatically when the script finishes.


6. Patchlunky URL Protocol
==========================
Patchlunky supports URL commands that can be used like web page links.

patchlunky://download/mod/<url>
patchlunky://download/char/<url>
  Opens a dialog for downloading the mod or character from the URL.
  For example: patchlunky://download/mod/https://www.site.net/download.php?file=214

For these links to work, you need to register the URL protocol with the setup wizard.
